_THEORY = r"""
## 1. The disease — overfitting

A high-capacity model has more than enough flexibility to **memorize** its training set —
including the random **noise**. It then scores great on training data but **fails on new
data**: training error falls to ~0 while **test** error stays high. That gap *is*
overfitting. In bias–variance terms (M0) it's **low bias, high variance** — the fit swings
wildly with whatever noise it happened to see.

## 2. Why it happens

Overfitting shows up when **capacity outruns the signal in the data**: too many parameters,
too little or too noisy data, or training too long. With 4 clean XOR points there's no noise
to fit, so capacity only helps; with **noisy** moons, a `40-40` net has ample room to wrap
around individual stray points. Note the cure isn't always "smaller model" — often it's the
**same** model, **constrained**.

## 3. The cure — penalize complexity

**Regularization** adds a penalty for complexity, so the optimizer only "spends" capacity
that genuinely lowers the loss. The workhorse is **L2** (a.k.a. ridge / **weight decay**):
add the squared size of the weights to the loss,
$$ \text{minimize}\quad L(\mathbf w) + \lambda\,\lVert\mathbf w\rVert_2^2. $$
$\lambda$ (scikit-learn's `alpha`) is the **strength dial**: $0$ = no penalty, large = weights
pushed hard toward $0$.

## 4. Why small weights = a smoother function

Big weights let a network make **steep, sharp** swings in its output — exactly the wiggles
needed to dart around noisy points. Penalizing $\lVert\mathbf w\rVert^2$ makes big weights
expensive, so the network settles for **smaller weights → gentler slopes → a smoother
boundary** that follows the trend instead of the noise. (Same mechanism as ridge regression
in M1.)

## 5. "Weight decay" — what it does to each step

Why the nickname? The penalty $\lambda\lVert\mathbf w\rVert^2$ contributes $2\lambda\mathbf w$
to the gradient, so a gradient step becomes
$$ \mathbf w \leftarrow \mathbf w - \eta\nabla L - 2\eta\lambda\mathbf w = (1-2\eta\lambda)\,\mathbf w \;-\; \eta\nabla L. $$
Every step first **shrinks** the weights by a small factor, *then* applies the usual update —
they "decay" toward zero unless the data keeps pushing back. (Modern nets use **AdamW**,
which decouples this decay cleanly — Optimizers page.)

## 6. The sweet spot (bias–variance, again)

- **Too little** $\lambda$ → wiggly boundary, big train–test gap (**overfit / high variance**).
- **Too much** $\lambda$ → weights crushed, boundary too smooth to capture the real shape
  (**underfit / high bias**).
- The best $\lambda$ sits **in between**, where *validation* accuracy peaks — chosen by a
  **validation set / cross-validation** (M6), never the test set. The **Tune** tab sweeps
  $\lambda$ and marks that peak.

## 7. L1 vs. L2

- **L2** ($\lVert\mathbf w\rVert_2^2$) shrinks *all* weights smoothly toward 0 — the default for nets.
- **L1** ($\lVert\mathbf w\rVert_1$) drives many weights to **exactly 0** → a **sparse** model
  / automatic feature selection (lasso, M1/M6); its diamond-shaped penalty makes zero-corners
  the likely solution.
- **Elastic net** blends the two.

## 8. Other regularizers (especially for nets)

- **Dropout** — randomly **zero a fraction of units each training step**, so the network
  can't lean on any single unit; it behaves like training a huge **ensemble** of sub-networks
  that share weights (averaged at test time).
- **Early stopping** — watch validation loss and **stop** when it starts rising; cheap and
  very effective.
- **Data augmentation / more data** — the most reliable cure of all: more (or cleverly
  varied) examples leave less room to memorize noise.
- **Batch norm**, smaller models, and label smoothing also regularize as a side effect.

## 9. The takeaway

Every regularizer trades a little **training fit** for a lot more **generalization** —
accepting slightly higher bias to kill variance. That trade *is* the central skill of
practical ML (M0 / M6), and **weight decay** is its everyday face in deep learning. *(Lab
tie-ins: Deep-nets page, M0 bias–variance, M6 model selection; `core/optim.py`.)*

### In the Tune tab
1. Slide $\lambda$ to its **smallest** value — describe the boundary and the train–test
   gap. Now slide to the **largest** — what happened to the boundary, and to *both*
   accuracies?
2. Find the $\lambda$ that maximizes **test** accuracy. Does it match the peak in the
   sweep curve?
3. Re-roll the **seed** — does the sweet-spot $\lambda$ move a lot? (That's why you tune it
   on validation, not guess.)

### Bridge
4. Connect L2 here to **ridge** (ML M1/M6), to **weight decay** in the ANN module, and to
   the bias–variance picture in **M0**.
5. Name two other regularizers you'd reach for in a deep net and when.
