## 1. What an optimizer does

Backprop hands you the gradient $\nabla L$ — the uphill direction for every weight. An
**optimizer** decides **how to step** with those gradients to drive the loss down. The base
move is gradient descent, $w \leftarrow w - \eta\,\nabla L$, but raw steps struggle on real
loss surfaces, so smarter rules (momentum, Adam) *shape* the step. This page races three on
the same surface.

## 2. Batch, stochastic & mini-batch

You can estimate the gradient on:
- the **whole dataset** (*batch* GD) — accurate but one step needs all the data → slow;
- **one example** (*stochastic* GD / SGD) — cheap and noisy, and the noise can help jump out
  of bad spots;
- a **mini-batch** of ~32–512 (the practical default) — best speed/accuracy trade-off and
  GPU-friendly.

"SGD" in practice means **mini-batch** SGD. That gradient noise is exactly why a real loss
curve is **jagged**, not a smooth glide.

## 3. The learning rate η — the #1 knob

$\eta$ scales every step. **Too large** → you overshoot and the loss **diverges** (flies
off); **too small** → it crawls and may never arrive. There's a stability ceiling set by the
surface's curvature (for a quadratic, roughly $\eta < 2/\text{(largest curvature)}$). It is
the single most impactful thing you tune — crank it in the demo to watch SGD blow up.

## 4. The hard case — ravines (ill-conditioning)

Real loss surfaces are **ill-conditioned**: far steeper in some directions than others (Math
**X4 §10**). Then $-\nabla L$ doesn't point at the minimum — it points mostly **across** a
long narrow valley. Plain GD **overshoots the steep direction and crawls the flat one**,
zig-zagging. The demo surface $f(x,y)=A x^2+y^2$ is exactly that: steep in $x$ (large $A$),
flat in $y$.

## 5. SGD — the baseline

$$ w \leftarrow w - \eta\,\nabla L. $$
Simple, memory-light, and with a good schedule still a top performer. Weaknesses: it
zig-zags in ravines and can **stall on plateaus and saddle points** — flat regions where
$\nabla L\approx0$, which are everywhere in high-dimensional nets.

## 6. Momentum — a heavy ball

Keep a **velocity** that exponentially averages recent gradients, and step with *that*:
$$ v \leftarrow \mu\,v + \nabla L,\qquad w \leftarrow w - \eta\,v. $$
Consistent directions (down the valley) **accumulate speed**; oscillating directions (across
the valley) **cancel**. So momentum rolls through ravines and coasts across plateaus — a
heavy ball with inertia. Typical $\mu=0.9$ (≈ averaging the last ~10 gradients);
**Nesterov** is a slightly look-ahead variant.

## 7. RMSProp — per-parameter scaling

Different weights can have wildly different gradient sizes. **RMSProp** divides each weight's
step by a running root-mean-square of *its own* recent gradients:
$$ s \leftarrow \rho\,s + (1-\rho)(\nabla L)^2,\qquad w \leftarrow w - \eta\,\frac{\nabla L}{\sqrt{s}+\varepsilon}. $$
A parameter with tiny gradients (the flat direction) still takes meaningful steps; one with
huge gradients (the steep direction) is reined in — directly attacking the ravine problem.

## 8. Adam = momentum + RMSProp

Adam combines both: a momentum-like mean $m$ **and** an RMSProp-like variance $v$, each an
exponential average, plus a **bias correction** (they start at 0, so early estimates are
scaled up):
$$ m\leftarrow\beta_1 m+(1-\beta_1)\nabla L,\qquad v\leftarrow\beta_2 v+(1-\beta_2)(\nabla L)^2, $$
$$ \hat m=\frac{m}{1-\beta_1^{\,t}},\quad \hat v=\frac{v}{1-\beta_2^{\,t}},\qquad w\leftarrow w-\eta\,\frac{\hat m}{\sqrt{\hat v}+\varepsilon}. $$
Dividing $\hat m$ by $\sqrt{\hat v}$ gives **each parameter its own effective step size** —
big where gradients are small, small where large — so Adam takes a near-direct route with
little tuning. Defaults $\beta_1=0.9,\ \beta_2=0.999,\ \eta\approx10^{-3}$. The **robust
default**, especially for transformers/LLMs. **AdamW** (decoupled weight decay) is the
common modern variant — it's what the e21 nanoGPT uses.

## 9. Schedules & weight decay

Two add-ons that pair with any optimizer:
- **Learning-rate schedule** — start higher, then **decay** (step / cosine), often after a
  short **warmup**: big steps early to make progress, small steps late to settle.
- **Weight decay** — gently shrink weights every step (L2 regularization) for better
  generalization (the **Regularization** page).

## 10. Which to use

- **Adam / AdamW** — the safe default; fast and forgiving. Start here.
- **SGD + momentum (+ a schedule)** — often **generalizes best** for large vision nets, at
  the cost of more tuning.
- Whatever you pick, **the learning rate is still the #1 knob** — in the demo, watch SGD
  diverge while Adam survives at the *same* $\eta$. *(Lab: `core/optim.py` implements SGD,
  Momentum and Adam.)*

### In the Compare tab
1. At the default learning rate, compare the three **paths** — which zig-zags, which rolls
   straight down the valley? Which reaches the minimum in the fewest steps (loss curve)?
2. Increase **ravine steepness A** — SGD's zig-zag gets worse; do momentum/Adam still cope?
3. Crank the **learning rate** up until **SGD diverges** (flies off the plot), then note
   that Adam often still survives. Now make it tiny — everything crawls.

### Pencil & paper
4. Write the momentum update and explain why it cancels oscillations but accelerates a
   steady descent.
5. In Adam, what happens to the effective step in a direction whose gradients are
   consistently **tiny**? Why does that help in a ravine?

### Code / bridge
6. Swap the optimizer in the **MLP** page (SGD ↔ Adam) and compare how fast XOR is solved.
7. Connect to Math **X4** (gradient descent, conditioning) and `core/optim.py` (these exact
   updates).
