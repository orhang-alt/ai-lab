The two tracks are not separate worlds — they meet at the **single neuron**:

| single neuron | + loss | = classical model |
|---|---|---|
| linear activation | MSE | **linear regression** (M1) |
| sigmoid activation | cross-entropy | **logistic regression** (M2) |

So everything you learn about weights, bias, and activations in the **ANN** module pays off
directly here — and vice-versa. Switch tracks anytime with the **Module** selector at the top
of the sidebar.
