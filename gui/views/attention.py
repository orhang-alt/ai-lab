_THEORY = r"""
## 1. Why attention

An MLP mixes its inputs with **fixed** weights — it treats position 3 the same way every
time. An RNN threads a sequence through one small running state, so distant tokens blur and
it must process **step by step** (slow). **Attention** lets each token **dynamically pull
information from any other token** — near or far, all in parallel — choosing *what to look
at* based on **content**, not position. That one idea removed the sequence bottleneck and
made **Transformers** (and modern **LLMs**) possible.

## 2. Tokens are vectors

First, text is split into **tokens** (here: characters; real LLMs use sub-word pieces), and
each token becomes a learned **embedding** vector. A length-$n$ sequence is then a matrix
$X$ of shape $n \times d$ (sequence length × model width). Everything below is operations on
these vectors — and "similarity" between them *is* the dot product (Math X1).

## 3. Query, Key, Value

From each token's vector the model makes three new vectors via **learned linear
projections** $W_Q,W_K,W_V$:
$$ Q = XW_Q,\qquad K = XW_K,\qquad V = XW_V. $$
- **Query (Q)** — "what am I looking for?"
- **Key (K)** — "what do I offer?"
- **Value (V)** — "what I'll hand over if you attend to me."

A token's query is matched against **every** token's key to decide how much of each token's
value to take. (Q/K/V are three learned "views" of the same token — that's why the
projections are separate, trainable matrices.)

## 4. Scaled dot-product attention

Three steps — **dot product → softmax → weighted sum**:
$$ \text{Attention}(Q,K,V) = \text{softmax}\!\Big(\frac{QK^\top}{\sqrt{d_k}}\Big)\,V. $$
1. **Scores** $QK^\top$ — an $n\times n$ matrix; entry $(i,j)$ is query $i$ · key $j$ = how
   well token $i$ matches token $j$ (Math X1).
2. **Scale & softmax** — divide by $\sqrt{d_k}$ (§6), then softmax **each row** (Math X5), so
   every token's scores become a probability distribution over all tokens — its **attention
   weights**.
3. **Weighted sum** — multiply by $V$: token $i$'s output is the attention-weighted blend of
   *every* token's value — a new, **context-aware** representation.

<FLOW/>

## 5. A tiny worked example

Suppose token $i$'s query yields raw scores $[2,\,0,\,1]$ against three keys (take
$d_k=1$, no scaling). Softmax → $[0.67,\,0.09,\,0.24]$. The output is
$0.67\,v_1 + 0.09\,v_2 + 0.24\,v_3$ — mostly token 1's value, a dash of token 3's. Nudge the
query to align with key 2 and the blend shifts toward $v_2$. That, per token and in parallel,
is the whole mechanism — the Live tab shows the full $n\times n$ weight matrix.

## 6. Why divide by √d

Dot products of $d_k$-dimensional vectors grow like $\sqrt{d_k}$. Left unscaled, large scores
shove softmax into its **saturated** corners (one weight ≈ 1, the rest ≈ 0) where its
gradient is almost zero — the vanishing problem (ANN §6). Dividing by $\sqrt{d_k}$ keeps
scores in a sane range so attention stays smooth and trainable.

## 7. Self-attention & multi-head

- **Self-attention** — Q, K, V all come from the *same* sequence, so every token attends to
  the others (what the Live tab shows). *(When they come from two sequences it's
  cross-attention — e.g. translation.)*
- **Multi-head** — split the $d$ dimensions into $h$ smaller **heads**, run attention in each
  independently, then concatenate and project. Each head can specialize — one tracks local
  context, another long-range coreference, another syntax — capturing several relationship
  types at once.

## 8. Position has to be added back

Attention is a weighted sum over a **set**, so on its own it has **no sense of order**
("dog bites man" ≈ "man bites dog" to raw attention). Transformers therefore add a
**positional encoding** to each token embedding — a fixed sinusoid or a learned
per-position vector — telling the model *where* each token sits. (The Tiny GPT page uses
learned position embeddings.)

## 9. The cost

The score matrix is $n\times n$, so self-attention is **$O(n^2)$** in time and memory —
quadratic in sequence length. That's why context windows are bounded and why lots of LLM
research chases cheaper/longer attention. The upside: it's **one big matrix multiply**, so
it parallelizes on GPUs — unlike an RNN's step-by-step loop, which is why Transformers
train so much faster.

## 10. It's all things you already know

Attention adds **no new math**: a **dot product** for similarity (Math X1), **softmax** for
a distribution (Math X5), a **weighted sum**, and learned projections (matrix multiplies,
X1). The genius is the *composition* — at every layer the data itself decides which tokens
inform which. Add a causal mask + an MLP into a **block**, repeat, cap with a next-token
softmax head, and you have a **GPT** (Tiny GPT page). Everything in this lab leads here:
neuron → MLP → backprop → attention → Transformer → LLM. *(Roadmap Tier 4–5.)*

### In the Live tab
1. Pick **cat** as the query — which tokens get the most weight, and why? Do the same for
   **sat**. (Animals attend to animals, verbs to verbs.)
2. Lower the **temperature** toward 0 — the attention sharpens toward one token (hard
   selection); raise it — attention flattens toward uniform. Relate this to softmax (X5).
3. Read the **heatmap**: which 2×2 blocks light up, and what relationship do they encode?

### Pencil & paper
4. With $q=(1,0)$ and keys $k_1=(1,0),\,k_2=(0,1),\,k_3=(-1,0)$, rank the attention weights
   before softmax. Which value gets blended in most?
5. Explain in one sentence why attention handles long-range dependencies better than an RNN.

### Bridge
6. Connect: dot product = **Math X1**, softmax = **Math X5**, the next-token loss =
   **M2 / X5** cross-entropy. Attention is these composed.
