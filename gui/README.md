# AI Lab GUI

A local Streamlit app over the lab. It's a thin, pure-Python layer that *reads the
lab from disk* and *reuses `core/`* — it keeps lessons, experiments, tests, and
scratch work in one place.

## Launch
```bash
cd ai-lab
./start.sh            # background, waits until healthy, prints the URL
./stop.sh             # kills the process and frees the port
./start.sh 8600       # custom port (stop with: ./stop.sh 8600)
```
Or run it in the foreground manually:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[gui]"          # streamlit + matplotlib + pandas (already installed)
streamlit run gui/app.py
```
Opens at http://localhost:8501. `start.sh` writes a PID to `.gui.pid` and logs to
`.gui.log` (both git-ignored).

## Tracks and screens
- **ANN** — a single neuron → backprop → architectures → attention → LLM practice.
- **ML** — classical machine-learning foundations, supervised/unsupervised methods,
  model selection, practical ML, and worked Python examples.
- **Math** — vectors, calculus, probability, optimization, information theory, and
  numerical computing.
- **Dashboard** — shows the learning path, scans lightweight experiments by default
  (`run.py`; 🟢 done / ⚪ todo / 🔴 error / ⏱️ deferred), and embeds `ROADMAP.md`.
- **Playgrounds** — interactive neuron, MLP, optimizer, regularization, attention,
  tokenization, and tiny-GPT lessons wired to the lab's reusable concepts.
- **Experiments** — per-experiment Overview (README), Code, Run (captures stdout),
  and an editable Notes tab saved back to `notes.md`.
- **Infobase** — renders the `infobase/*.md` notes.
- **Tests** — runs `pytest -q` and shows passed/skipped/failed.
- **Sandbox** — local-only Python scratchpad, enabled by `./start.sh` through
  `AILAB_ENABLE_SANDBOX=1`.

## Layout
```

├── app.py            # entrypoint: st.navigation over the views
├── lab.py            # disk discovery + run helpers (the only "model" layer)
└── views/            # one file per screen

    ├── math_*.py

    └── tests.py
```

## Extending
Adding an experiment under `experiments/tierN_*/eNN_*/` makes it appear
automatically (Dashboard, Experiments). New `infobase/*.md` notes appear in the
Infobase screen with no code change.
